                <p>I have several skills that I can apply to several jobs such as I am amazing in everything that has to do with technology and I can program very well see <a href="#Programming"></a> for more info. I was also stage crew in my primary school which means I managed all the tech for example, lights, sound, microphones, presentation and more. Also in my freetime whenever my family has an old or broken computer I take it apart and admire the compnents of the pc. I actually have a picture frame up in my room that has the inside of a laptop in it. And just like I said before im learning new various skills quickly. Anyway if you are interested in me doing a job for you that requires a sertain skill that I do not have I'll be happy to learn it. </p>
